All three of my concepts are games, and I plan to combine p5.js with Arduino.

# Concept 1:
A racing game where the player avoids obstacles. Two buttons are used to control the car's left and right movements to dodge obstacles on the road. As the game progresses, the speed increases. 
The current "speed" will be displayed on the Arduino screen. The farther you go (the longer you survive), the higher your score.

# Concept 2:
Flappy Bird. Yes, it's a recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game. 
Players press a button to make the bird fly and avoid obstacles.

# Concept 3:
A tug-of-war game, which is my favorite concept. This is a two-player game where each player presses their button as fast as possible to represent their "strength." 
The player with the greater speed and effort wins the match.
